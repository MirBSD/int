deb-cross:
- x32 - needs vmaction with debian kernel and custom kernel parameters
- others gone:
  - armel in trixie
  - mips64el in bookworm
  - mipsel in bullseye on archive.d.o
  - mips in buster
  - arm in lenny
  - ia64 in wheezy
  - sparc in etch (v8+ until wheezy)
  - s390 in wheezy
  but the current job builds with cross-gcc in sid, as long as it works…
